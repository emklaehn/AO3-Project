# AO3-Project

---

This is a project where I scrape and analyze data from AO3 (Archive of Our Own). AO3 is a popular website containing tons of fanfiction data. More of the data is discussed in the R Shiny application, "".

### Web Scraping the Data

If you are needing to scrape the AO3 data, use "WebScraping.ipynb" to do that. There are instructions in the Jupyter notebook that tells you how to do that. To use the code, one will need to install the pandas and bs4 Python libraries. Use the following code below in your terminal or environment to do so:

```
pip install bs4
pip install pandas
```

### Using the R Shiny Application
